# Strategy Pattern

## Overview

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern enables the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, making it particularly useful in AI systems where different strategies, such as optimization techniques or data processing methods, need to be applied dynamically based on the context or requirements.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility in Algorithm Selection:** The Strategy Pattern allows easy switching between different algorithms or strategies, providing flexibility in AI systems to adapt to various tasks or data conditions without modifying the core logic.
- **Code Reusability:** By encapsulating algorithms into separate classes, the pattern promotes reusability of code across different parts of the system, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Simplified Code Structure:** The Strategy Pattern helps keep the codebase clean and manageable by separating the concerns of algorithm selection from the actual implementation, making the system easier to understand and extend.

## Use Cases

- **Optimization Techniques:** In AI systems, the Strategy Pattern can be used to switch between different optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent variants, depending on the problem or data characteristics.
- **Data Processing Methods:** The pattern allows for dynamic selection of data processing techniques, such as normalization, feature extraction, or dimensionality reduction, based on the specific requirements of the AI model.
- **Decision-Making Algorithms:** In decision-making systems, different strategies, such as rule-based, machine learning-based, or heuristic approaches, can be applied dynamically using the Strategy Pattern to achieve the best results.

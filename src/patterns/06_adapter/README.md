# Adapter Pattern

## Overview

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern is especially useful in AI systems where different components, libraries, or services need to be integrated despite having incompatible interfaces.

## Benefits

- **Interface Compatibility:** The Adapter Pattern ensures that components with incompatible interfaces can work together, enabling seamless integration of different AI models, data sources, or external services into a unified system.
- **Reusability of Existing Components:** By adapting existing components to work with new interfaces, the pattern promotes the reuse of existing code, reducing the need to rewrite or duplicate functionality.
- **Flexibility in System Design:** The Adapter Pattern provides flexibility in system design by allowing new components to be integrated without modifying existing code, making it easier to extend and maintain the system.

## Use Cases

- **Model Integration:** The Adapter Pattern can be used to integrate AI models with different input/output formats into a common interface, allowing them to be used interchangeably in the same system.
- **Data Source Integration:** When integrating multiple data sources with varying schemas or APIs, the Adapter Pattern can standardize the data format, enabling consistent data processing across the system.
- **Legacy System Interfacing:** The pattern is useful for integrating legacy systems with modern AI components, allowing old and new systems to work together without extensive refactoring.

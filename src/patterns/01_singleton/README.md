# Singleton Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is particularly useful in scenarios where exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing configuration settings, logging, or database connections.

## Benefits

- **Controlled Access to a Single Instance:** The Singleton pattern provides a single point of control for a shared resource, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application's lifecycle.
- **Reduced Memory Footprint:** By limiting the number of instances created, the Singleton pattern can help reduce the memory overhead associated with multiple instances.
- **Global Access:** Since the Singleton instance is globally accessible, it can be easily used across different parts of the application without needing to pass the instance around.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Some Singleton implementations provide lazy initialization, which means the instance is only created when it is first needed.

## Use Cases

- **Configuration Management:** A Singleton can be used to manage configuration settings for an application, ensuring that the settings are consistent and accessible from anywhere within the application.
- **Logging:** A Singleton Logger can be used to ensure that all parts of an application write to the same log file, providing a centralized logging mechanism.
- **Database Connections:** Singleton can be used to manage a single database connection pool or a database connection instance to avoid the overhead of establishing multiple connections.
- **Thread Pool Management:** A Singleton can be used to manage a thread pool, ensuring that all threads are created and managed centrally.

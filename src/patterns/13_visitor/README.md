# Visitor Pattern

## Overview

The Visitor Pattern allows you to define new operations on objects without altering their structure.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps operations separate from object structures.
- **Adheres to Open/Closed Principle:** Add new operations without modifying existing code.
- **Ease of Extensibility:** Simplifies adding new operations across a class hierarchy.
- **Handles Complex Structures:** Useful for operations on intricate object hierarchies.

## Use Cases

- **Compilers:** Operations on abstract syntax trees.
- **File Systems:** Actions on files and directories.
- **Document Processing:** Applying formats or operations to document parts.
